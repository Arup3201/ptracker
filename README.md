## Set up

Change directory to `backend` first to startup the necessary database applications.

Use docker-compose to run the instances in the background (`-d`).

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

It should start the necessary databases.

Then you can run the go server with,

```sh
go run main.go
```

It should start the server as well as create all the database tables necessary for the app to run through migrations.

```

```

```

```
